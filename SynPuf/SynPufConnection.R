# script to connect to the hack-a-thon SYNPUF database in Amazon AWS
# thanks to Lee Evans!

# On Windows, make sure RTools is installed.
# The DatabaseConnector and SqlRender packages require Java. Java can be downloaded from http://www.java.com.
# In R, use the following commands to download and install some packages:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("ohdsi/OhdsiRTools") 
install_github("ohdsi/SqlRender")
install_github("ohdsi/DatabaseConnector")

library(DatabaseConnector)
library(SqlRender)

# The cdm schema contains all the cdm tabels and vocabulary and is read only
# There is "scratch" schema that is writable in which you can create your own tables.
# Please add your name in the table name to not clash with other participants, e.g rijnbeek-cohort
